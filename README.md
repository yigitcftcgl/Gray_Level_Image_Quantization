# Gray_Level_Image_Quantization
Image quantization and analysis for grayscale images. This project involves reducing grayscale images from 8-bit to lower bit depths (7-bit to 1-bit), comparing the images rescaled to the 0-255 range, and evaluating differences using MAE and PSNR metrics. Includes visualization of quantized and rescaled images, along with analysis results.
